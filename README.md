Mu-SHROOM

Welcome to the official shared task website for Mu-SHROOM, a SemEval-2025 shared task!

Mu-SHROOM stands for “Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes”. Mu-SHROOM will invite participants to detect hallucination spans in the outputs of instruction-tuned LLMs in a multilingual context. This shared task builds upon our previous iteration, SHROOM, with a few key changes:

We’re looking at multiple languages: Arabic (Modern standard), Chinese (Mandarin), English, Finnish, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish;
We’re now focusing on LLM outputs;
Participants will have to predict where the hallucination occurs.
This website is under construction. More information will be available soon.
